 <p>Giant sparrow is a small indie game development company based out of LA, California.
<br>Currently they have only two games (both available on PlayStation, iOS and windows via Steam), What remains of Edith Finch and The Unfinished Swan. Both games adopt a familiar yet unsettling nostalgic feeling, one that isn’t what is seems.
<br>They currently have one game in the works, based on the wonders and horrors of biology.
