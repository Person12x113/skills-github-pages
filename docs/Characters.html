      <h1>Overview</h1>
      Barbara Finch, the daughter of Grandma Edie and a former child actress destined for fame, finds her tragic tale
      explored through an engaging comic book and RPG-style gameplay. The narrative immerses players in the fateful
      night of her mysterious disappearance, where her ear is the only trace left behind, discovered inside a music box.
      <br>The comic presents a chilling account, weaving a story about Halloween monsters and a "man with a hook," that
      killed Barbra. Her boyfriend's abandoned crutch and fantastical nature create an eerie and unsettling retelling of
      a morbid tragedy, blurring the lines of a supernatural fiction and grief ridden reality.

    <div class="bugs">
      <h2>Common Bugs:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li> Getting stuck at the fridge: when walking towards the fridge during the “old fridge rattled and grew still"
          text, don’t hesitate and walk directly at the fridge, else risking that you might get stuck, only being able
          to crouch. To get out just close and restart the game. This bug has not been patched specifically.</li>
        <li>Unable to use the crutch: After attaining Barbra’s boyfriend's crutch, some players couldn't swing the
          crutch as it would clip through everything else. If the crutch is clipping through objects instead of hitting
          them, lower your graphics settings, e.g: “ultra” to “low” for this section. After Barbras chapter you can
          return the quality.</li>

      Portrait of Molly Finch
    </div>
    <div class="maintext">
      <h1>Overview</h1>
      Molly is the daughter of great grandma Edie and Sven. After being sent to bed with no dinner, Molly scavenges for
      food in her room and soon leaps out the window, turning into a cat to chase a bird. Catching a variety of prey,
      she turns into an owl, a shark and finally a tentacle monster.
      All of this is written in her diary on the day of her death. She then writes the tentacle monster is under bed, as
      hungry as she was and ready to eat her.
      <br>This disturbing and surreal chapter sets the tone for the game, a morbid and oddly comforting yet uneasy game,
      that offers a home full of warmth and life polluted by death and trauma.
    </div>
    <div class="bugs">
      <h2>Common Bugs:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li> The sea monster: in the sea monster segment, players often freeze after eating the sailors, and especially
          when going for extra achievements such as eating extra animals. The bug has not yet been patched. In order to
          unfreeze, close and open the game. This will restart the molly chapter however.</li>

      <h1>Lewis Finch</h1>
    </div>
    <h2>1988-2010</h2>
    <img src="lewisfinch.jpg">
    <div class="maintext">
      <h1>Overview</h1>
      Lewis worked at a cannery, but his daydreams—controlled by the mouse for reality and the keyboard for
      imagination—gradually overtook his life. In these fantasies, he traveled through a labyrinth to Lewistopia, became
      mayor, and conquered cities like New Lewisville and St. Lewis. He forgot to leave the cannery as his imagination
      consumed his view, blurring the lines between reality and fantasy. He despised the cannery and saw his imaginary
      self as the true Lewis, ultimately bowing his head to the guillotine in his imagined kingdom.

    <div class="bugs">
      <h2>Common Bugs:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li> The beginning at the cannery: This bug prevents you from picking up the fish in order to continue the
          story. If you cannot pick up the fish, exit and restart the game.
        </li>
        <li> Stairs to the coronation: Towards the end of Lewis's minigame, Lewis walks up a flight of stairs to reicive
          his crown in his fictiious mind. However, be careful to avoid walking into the guards as you ascend the stairs
          as it will cause a collision bug, freezing the player. If this does happens, quit and reload the game. Note
          that other players took multiple restarts for this segment to work. This bug had not been patched.
