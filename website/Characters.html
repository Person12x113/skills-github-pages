    <h1>Overview</h1>
    Barbara Finch, the daughter of Grandma Edie and a former child actress destined for fame, finds her tragic tale explored through an engaging comic book and RPG-style gameplay. The narrative immerses players in the fateful night of her mysterious disappearance, where her ear is the only trace left behind, discovered inside a music box.
  <br>The comic presents a chilling account, weaving a story about Halloween monsters and a "man with a hook," that killed Barbra. Her boyfriend's abandoned crutch and fantastical nature create an eerie and unsettling retelling of a morbid tragedy, blurring the lines of a supernatural fiction and grief ridden reality.

   <h2>Common Bugs:</h2>
  <ul>
  <li> Getting stuck at the fridge: when walking towards the fridge during the “old fridge rattled and grew still" text, don’t hesitate and walk directly at the fridge, else risking that you might get stuck, only being able to crouch. To get out just close and restart the game. This bug has not been patched specifically.</li>
  <li>Unable to use the crutch: After attaining Barbra’s boyfriend's crutch, some players couldn't swing the crutch as it would clip through everything else. If the crutch is clipping through objects instead of hitting them, lower your graphics settings, e.g: “ultra” to “low” for this section. After Barbras chapter you can return the quality.</li>
